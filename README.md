This is a copy of the version 1.2.1 of `TestSurvRec` package developed by Carlos Martinez (cmmm7031@gmail.com). 
The package has been removed from CRAN since it depends on `survrec` package that has also been removed from CRAN. 

There is no problem neither with `survrec` or `TestSurvRec`. I have decided to remove `survrec` from CRAN since there are many issues (NOTEs)
with Fortran compilers that are hard to be fixed (e.g. change names of variables, format of the file, ...). Installing the packages from GitHub
avoid fixing these irrelevant NOTEs that do not pass CRAN checks.
